      "content"  : "Finding information about ice climbing in Japan can be a daunting task to say the least. Where to go? When? How to get there? What about guidebooks? How about weather? The list goes on…Winter camping near Sounkyo by -18°C - Hokkaido - JapanCredits: Gregor NeumannOverview of ice climbing in JapanJapan is a great country for ice climbing, due to its cold winter. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these winter typically come loaded with insane amounts of snowfall, often making access difficult. The best period is typically from december to february, although some rare falls might be formed earlier and last slightly longer. Ice falls can be found here and there throughout north Japan, with some well-known areas such as Yatsugatake, Yonagofudo, Sounkyo (Hokkaido) to name but a few. Access by public transport is usually hard, or downright impossible (except to at least add a significant taxi fare). Car is pretty much the only reasonable way of getting to most places. Beware that Japan tends to get insane amount of snowfall during winter, and you will need winter tires and 4 wheel drive. I’ve personally managed to get everywhere, including Hokkaido in January, with a 4WD Suzuki Wagon Kei-car. More often than not, expect a significant approach hike through snow. Some approaches are best done on skis. Due to this difficult access, it is very common to go for multiple days and winter bivy.                                                                                                                                                Guidebook: Ice climbing and mountaineering guidebooks are somewhat lacking. Your best bet is the 新版 アイスクライミング 全国版 (クライミング・ガイドブックス) (Ice Climbing - National Edition - Climbing Guidebooks) book  [amazon link] that covers all of Japan. Unfotunately it is in Japanese only and heavily relies on text descriptions. It has black on white pictures of most falls, and a few color ones at the begining.My intent here is not to replace the guidebook, but rather to provide an overview of some of the main areas that I’ve personally been to, and whenever possible map/GPS coordinates of the parking and falls. You will hopefully be able to find further information in the guidebook and on yamareco (by looking up the japanese name of the falls). Also note that Instagram tends to be a good source of live information to figure out the conditions (although for the most popular falls, expect a small crowd once it gets well-known that the conditions are good).HonshuThinking about ice climbing in Japan, the first place that comes to mind is Hokkaido. But don’t let that fool you, the main island Honshu is just as teeming with ice-falls, although the ice season is shorter, roughly december to end of february.Yatsugatake (八ヶ岳連峰)The Yatsugatake Mountains (八ヶ岳連峰 - eight peaks mountain) are a volcanic mountain range on the border between Nagano Prefecture and Yamanashi Prefecture. It was formed by repeated eruptions of older much larger volcanoes. Legend has it that Yatsugatake was once higher than Fuji, but Konohanasakuya-hime, the goddess of Mount Fuji, tore it down out of jealousy. This leaves a realatively easy to access mountain range, with multiple smaller peaks of interest for climbing. In the winter, Yatsugatake turns into a freezer with temperatures often under around -10/-15°C, and sees considerably less snow fall than its neighbouring mountain ranges (South and North alps). This makes it a perfect candidate for ice and mixed climbing, altough its proximity to Tokyo and relative ease of access means that the most popular falls tend to be crowded, especially on weekends.Important note: Don’t get fooled by the ease of access and relatively moderate altitude. Weather patterns can be extremely serious, and tends to change very rapidly. Wind and snowstorm, combined with the low temperatures can be particularely deadly if you get caught unaware.  Access: The trailhead starts at the lodge 八ケ岳山荘. This trailhead is accessible by a combination of train and taxi (around 6000-8000yen from the station). You can sleep there for cheap if needed. If you have a car with winter tires and chains, depending on road conditions, you might be able to make it as far as the lodge 赤岳山荘, which saves about 3km of walking. Note that this dirt road tends to be very icy, take care. From there, walk for about 2 hours along the trail leading to the Akadake Kosen Hut 赤岳鉱泉. It is very common to camp around the hut for a small fee. From the hut, one can access the many climbing options around.Here is a map of the approach to 大同心 waterfall passing by the Akadake Kosen hut and the 行者小屋 on the way down.  Accomodation: Camping or Hut  Information          Website Akadake Kosen / Gyosha Hut      Instagram @akadakekousen_gyoujyagoya      Facebook @akadake1959            Difficulty: Lots of choice from very easy WI3 to hard ice/mixed climbs    Classic climbs:          Akadake Kosen Ice Candy: Artificial ice fall next to the hut. Rental gear is available at the hut. Toprope only (I believe that you need to bring your own rope).      大同心 waterfall ([MAP] / [GPX]): ~50m waterfall, WI4. From the hut, walk up the trail through the forest. The trail eventually turns to the left and the path ahead is blocked by a rope. There pass under the rope and continue up the riverbed until you reach the base of the waterfall. For a more complete adventure you can continue climbing the couloir above and link it with the classic mixed climb of Shodoushin Crack (小同心クラック) (full route description), or of the Daidoushin Ryo (full route description).      West face Shu-ryo of Akadake (赤岳主稜) (route description). Easy mixed climbing leading to the ridge just short of the summit of Akadake.      There is another popular waterfall at 35°58’37.5”N 138°20’52.3”E. From Akadake Kosen, walk to the next hut 行者小屋. Just after the hut, take the path leading down on your right until you reach the river. From there follow the river until you reach the waterfall, about a hundred meters up on your left accross the river.

YonagofudoYonagofudo is known for its hard multipitch ice falls, some of which boasting over 120m of WI5 climbing.  Access: The road leading to Yonagofudo is only partially cleared in the winter. You should be able do drive until an intersection a few hundreds meters after the 水神様 shrine, about here. If you’re lucky you might be able to keep making it up the road until reaching a closed barrier a few kilometers higher. Watch out as you might very well be able to drive up on the hard packed snow in the early morning but might not be able to make it back down in the afternoon after the snow has softened (last time I went there my kei car bottomed out and got stuck and we had to dig it out). I’ve heard similar stories from multiple locals. Upon reaching the barrier up the road, keep walking (snowshoes or skis) for about 2 to 3 hours until you eventually see the falls in front of you. There is a bridge on your left, ignore it and keep going straight towards the falls. About 100m after the bridge is the area where people typically camp. Store the gear you don’t need there, and keep going towards your project :)  Difficulty: Very hard. WI4 and above, with a large majority of harder multipitch falls (WI5, WI6).  Weather conditions: Generally mild weather with cold temperatures.  Accomodation: Wild bivy          [GPX access]: the track goes from the road barrier past the campground until Anaconda/Cobra ice falls then returns to the camp near the bridge        Best period: Late January to early February. Most falls are WI5 and above, with many pillars and hanging structures. They tend to form late in the season and remain in conditions for short periods of time.  Classic climbs:          Cobra: 120m, WI5 with a snow slope between the firsts and last pitches [GPX approach from camp] (rightmost climb in this area)      Cobra left: WI5+/WI6, left of Cobra, this route is rarely in condition [a few meters left of Cobra]      Anaconda (WI4+, 3 pitches) [left of Cobra Left]      Dragon God (WI4, ~60m) [left of Anaconda ~50m walk]                                                                                                                                                                              Your browser does not support the video tag.OyafudoDisclaimer: Due to a conflict between local climbers and the landowners (temple?) a few years ago, access to this area is currently discouraged (as of 2021). From what I’ve gathered from the locals, the conflict arised over fecal matter due to the high popularity of the area, relatively easily accessible from Tokyo. Sadly I’m not sure if any steps are being taken to try and resolve the issue, it seems to be more of a wait-and-see situation. If you decide to ignore this disclaimer, please be particularely respectful and leave no trace.Access: Drive up a forest road (not cleared) as high as you dare, then snowshoe/ski up along the road for about 2 hours. There are multiple falls, here is the [GPX track] from where we parked the car (big 4WD SUV) to access the one in picture below (I don’t recall the name).Difficulty: Hard. WI4 and above, with a majority of very hard climbs.                                                                                                                                                ArafuneyamaGunma prefecture is not particularely known for ice climbing. Yet Arafuneyama has some high quality ice-falls, along with some gullies and mixed routes.  Access: The trailhead is located around the shinto shrine 荒船神社奥の院  Accomodation: You can sleep in your car at the trailhead (but the parking lot is small and not flat). From there you can reach two separate areas. Aizawa is reached by following the road for a while and taking a trail to the right along the river  Difficulty: Easy to hard. WI3+ and above  Classic climbs:          Dog Killing Waterfall (犬殺しの滝 - Inukoroshi no Taki)  - WI4 pillar, ~50m                  GPX access: Don’t follow the uphill bend in the path towards the end of our approach (wrong), instead keep on following our return path along the river until you reach the fall.                    Aizawa Black Wall (相沢奥壁大氷柱) - WI4+, 50m (GPX access).      Aizawa (相沢) - April’s Fool (エイプリルフール) (GPX access) - WI4. Multiple possible lines, and about 3 pitch route.      There are also mixed routes and gullies, and some harder ice falls                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Unryukeikoku Falls (雲竜渓谷)The area around Nikko has the poptential for many interesting waterfall. Unfortunately good ice conditions are hard to come by. The best period generally seems to be late-january. The most well-known climbable area is Unryukeikoku Falls (雲竜渓谷). It also happens to be a popular hike, and on good sunny days you can expect a crowd there (litteraly hundreds of people when we went there in the weekend in early February 2021).Unryukeikoku Ice Falls slowly forming - 20 December 2020  Access: From the trailhead parking Unryukeikokutozanguchi Parking Lot - 雲竜渓谷登山口駐車場, walk for about 2h until you reach the Unryu Keikoky Falls. Note that if the river is not frozen, the falls are very difficult to access as you have to walk above the river bed for a few hundred meters at the end (but in that case they probably aren’t formed anyways).  Best period: Might be in condition for a short amount of time around late January. The main fall takes the sun from around mid-day. The smaller pillars are somewhat more protected from the sun, but being freestanding structures they need consistent low temperatures. I tried going twice last year: 1 december 2020 (not fully formed yet) and 6th February 2021 (already melting). It seems that around the week of 15th January conditions were good.  Information:          Nikko’s frozen waterfalls: Unryu Keikoku [japan-guide.com]: Excellent source of information and beautiful pictures (and I’m not just saying that just because the article was written by my good friend Joe Mignano).

It also happens to be a heaven for ice climbing, with its low temperatures, and multitude of ice falls. The most well-known area is the Sounkyo gorge teeming with multipitch waterfalls a short walk above the river.Sōunkyō Gorge (層雲峡)Located in the Daisetsuzan National Park, the Sounkyo Gorge is a world reknowned ice climbing venue. With its steep walls looming above the Ishikari river, teeming with hundred meters waterfalls, each steeper and bigger than its neighbour. It is also reknowned for its ice climbing festival with its man-made ice village, held around February every year.  Access: Drive to the free parking lot Ginga Waterfall Parking Lot (銀河・流星の滝駐車場). The main falls Ryu Sei no Taki and Ginga no Taki are visible from the parking lot. Most falls are located along the Ishikari river, upstream from the parking lot. To access more remote falls, it is recommended to walk along the closed road on the right river bank (on the parking lot side). Note that you will need to find a way to cross the river as there is no bridge.  Further information:          General information on the area        Difficulty: Hard. WI4 and above  Classic climbs:          Ginga Waterfall (GPX): 3 pitches, WI4      Kumoino Falls (GPX - note: don’t follow the same approach path that we did, instead prefer taking our return path along the road on the right river bank (parking side)) - WI4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      River crossing on the approach to Ginga Waterfall - 07 January 2021Credits: Gregor NeumannMount Raiden (雷電山)Mount Raiden (雷電山) is home to the Kumamono Falls (雲間の滝) and can only be described as a stunning ice climbing venue. Imagine steep multipich ice falls above steep snow slopes, overlooking the ocean. Simply stunning.  Access:          Park at the free parking lot 敷島内 風の駐車場 along the seaside just after a tunnel’s exit. The falls are visible from the parking lot.      Walk above the tunnel to the left of the parking lot (facing away from the sea) and follow the most logical path towards the falls. There is about 300m of elevation through snow slopes. You can do it either with snowshoes or skis, but be aware that for the most part this goes through dense trees and bamboos.      [GPX]: Don’t follow the same approach path we did as we went too far to the right and ended up having to traverse and do a short rappel to access the fall. Instead follow our descent path.        Difficulty: Very Hard.

West coastWhen conditions are right, many ice falls can form along the west coastline of Hokkaido. Unfortunately for us, when we travelled around Hokkaido during the first week of January 2021, most falls weren’t fully formed yet, or downright inexistant, with the exception of Mount Raiden described above. Here is an overview of the partially formed ones that we could find:                                                                                    ",

If you ask about climbing in Japan, most people will happily point you in the direction of Ogawayama, which is undeniably one of the best sport climbing area in the country. But this can’t be the only crag worth visiting now, can it? Of course not, but unfortunaltely discovering climbing areas relies mostly on the set of 4 guidebooks “フリークライミング 日本100岩場” (Free climbing japan, 100 rocks), that do nothing to inspire you to actually go climbing. These books, available in Japanese only, only contain vague descriptions of the climbing areas, and poorly drawn access maps and sketches of the main routes in each area. This information is often out-of-date, and missing a lot of recent developments. Still it remains the most comprehensive overview of most Japanese sport and trad climbing crags. This article compiles a list of some of the main climbing crags, along with pictures to hopefully inspire you to go and visit them!Mizugaki is teeming with huge granite pillars full of cracks, roofs and hard face climbs. Here looking out towards Toichimen from the summit of Ozura Iwa.GuidebooksHere is a list (non-comprehensive) of the main guidebooks. Most of them can be found at the Calafate shop near Ogawayama/Mizugaki. If you’re in the area, I invite you to visit them as they are very knowledgeable and friendly towards foreigners.  フリークライミング 日本100岩場” (Free climbing japan, 100 rocks) - 4 volumes:          フリークライミング日本100岩場1 北海道・東北 増補改訂版: Volume 1, covering all of Tohoku area and Hokkaido (Yamadera, Misaki, Samuraihama, Hyoutan Cave, etc).      フリークライミング日本100岩場 2 関東: Volume 2 covering the Kanto area (Kogashiyama, Shiobara boulder, Shimonita boulder, Kasama, etc)      フリークライミング　日本100岩場 3 伊豆・甲信 : Volume 3 covering the Izu/Koshin area (Ogawayama, Jogasaki, etc)      フリークライミング 日本100岩場 4 東海・関西: Volume 4 covers the Tokai/Kansai area (South Japan)        Mizugaki Climbing Guidebook - English Edition: This is the most well-made guidebook I’ve ever seen, it has it all.

Mizugaki Bouldering Area Guide (Japanese and English): Excellent bouldering guidebook with high quality pictures and easy to understand access maps.  Ogawayama Bouldering Area GuideGeneral guidelines  Best season is typically spring and autumn. Summer is far too warm and humid (your best bet is Mizugaki/Ogawayama due to their high elevation), and in winter is usually too cold and snowy (ice climbing is great though).  Toproping on fixed gear is usually not acceptable. Build your own anchor for toprope.  Anchors are of various quality: from the omnipresent american death triangle on a bunch of slings from the last millenia to bomber chained anchors on glue-in bolts. In most areas there will be two carabiners that you can clip for lowering, but sometimes rings are used instead.  Bolts vary in quality. You can find anything from old ringbolts, rusty 6mm bolts, to bomber 12mm expansion bolts or glue-ins. Sometimes all within the same area.  Be respectful, leave no trace, replace fixed gear when damaged, respect the local rules (notably on parking)  Bouldering: You can generally use other’s crashpad if they’re already placed on a boulder you want to climb (just ask).Mizugaki (みずがき山)Mizugaki is one of the largest climbing areas of Japan, with a rich climbing history. It has it all, bouldering, sport and trad, multipitch, and no matter how much you climb there you won’t ever run out of things to climb. Mizugaki’s multipich routes are a true heaven for granite and offwidth lovers!  Prefecture: Yamanashi  Access: Mizugakiyamashizen Koen Camping Ground  Accomodation: Campground or you can sleep in your car in the free parking lot in front  Access fee: Free  Style: Trad multipich, sport multipitch, trad and sport single pitch, bouldering  Rock type: Granite  Guidebook: The Mizugaki guidebook is excellent, please refer to it for futher inspiration and all the information you will ever need for climbing in Mizugaki!  Best period: Spring and Autumn. However due to its high elevation above 1600m, it is one of the best areas to survive climbing during the hot summer months. Winter is tricky, as temperatures are cold, and the access road to the main parking area is closed due to snow, which adds about a kilometer of walking.Joe Mignano climbing Razor's Edge - 5.10d                                                                                                                                                                    Ogawayama (小川山)Ogawayama is a world-reknowned sport climbing and bouldering area, and is, along with its neighbour Mizugaki the biggest climbing area in Japan.  Prefecture: Yamanashi/Nagano border  Access: Mawarimedaira Camping Ground  Accomodation: Campground (website). No need for reservation there is more than enough space for everyone. You can arrive at anytime, simply take a ticket at the automated gate, set up your tent and go pay the next morning with your ticket. Be careful that if you wish to leave the campground and come back (for a supermarket run for instance), you’ll need to get the staff at the hut to validate your ticket so that you can get out. If for some reason you need to leave during the night, be sure you’ve asked them beforehand or you’ll be stuck inside!  Access fee: 500yen/day/person to be paid at the Hut at the entrance (you can use the basic campground facilities such as water).  Style: Single-pitch sport and trad, multipitch, bouldering  Rock type: Granite  Guidebook: Unfortunately there is no dedicated guidebook to Ogawayama’s sport climbing yet, although one is rumored to be under development. Refer to the “free climbing japan vol 2” or ogawayama.online. For bouldering: Ogawayama Bouldering Area Guide  Best period: Same as Mizugaki. In the winter the campground is closed and the road is proabably inaccessible (at least from the lower campground gate).Mara Budgen climbing the classic 5.12a route in Godzilla Iwa - Ogawayama - 05 June 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Futagoyama (二子山)  Prefecture: Yamanashi  Access: Futagoyama Parking Lot. Walk up the hiking trail until you reach a small col, the climbing areas are a few hundred meters down on the other side of that col.

In fact, it receives so much snow that it cannot be accessed until spring (usually late April) and can be skied until late into July! Even though Gassan Ski Resort exists, it consists of a single lift that brings you only about 400m above the parking lot, not even as high as the smallest nearest summit (姥ヶ岳). This single lift, however, provides a most welcome shortcut to access the backcountry. And what a place to enjoy spring backcountry skiing! With meters of snow still on the mountain, gentle slopes, and a beautiful landscape that on good days extends all the way to the sea. Most people contempt themselves with skinning up Mount Gassan to its summit 1984 meters above sea level (making it the highest of the three mountains of Dewa Sanzan). However for those that want to look further, and away from the crowds, and interesing option presents itself in the form of a two days ski traverse from Gassan Ski Resort to Hijiori Onsen, a small hot spring resort located on the other side of the mountain range. Add to this an extra thrid day for the necessary logistics of coming back to the starting point by public transports. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any english description of this wonderful traverse, the best source of information being the great but japanese-only guidebook: 山スキー百山 (Mountain Skiing - 100 mountains) [Amazon]. Despite this, its great maps and pictures still allow you to get inspired and find your way around fairly reasonably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mount Gassan  Day 1: Gassan Ski Resort - Mount Gassan - Hut  Duration: 6-7 hours  Distance: about 10km  Elevation: +550m/-1100m                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mount Gassan ascent  The first day takes you from Gassan Ski Resort to the summit of Mount Gassan, before dropping down its east face all the way down to a snow covered river, and a short skinning back out to a large plain that eventually leads to the hut 念仏ヶ原避難小屋 (unmanaged, but very well maintained and furnished).I started from the parking lot of Gassan Ski Resort at around 9am, definitely not early, but not too late either. Walk from the parking lot to the one and only ski lift, that brings you up a few hundred meters. From there, either skin up the small nearest summit (姥ヶ岳) right in front of the lift, or cut accross its slope for a more direct route. Then, follow the ridgeline and go straight up the face of Gassan. Most people either use ski crampons or walking crampons on the steepest slope. In any case, you will need to carry for the final 100m of rocky path before the summit. In my case, I had the good idea to forget my sleeping pad back at the car, and the even better idea to only notice this halfway up to the summit. This cost me a good hour and a half (skiing down, reorganizing my gear, taking the lift again and skinning back up). This mishap can clearly be seen on the track below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Ski descent of Mount Gassan  After reaching the summit, head down the east side of gassan. After dropping down from the summit, you’ll notice two hills on both side of what would be a riverbed. You want to stick to the rightside as much as possible. Be careful as the bottom of that slope leads to a large cornice handing over a steep drop. Keep to the right of that drop, about 50m further down you’ll reach a steep face going all the way down to the riverbed. Watch out, as the transition into the face features some large deep glide cracks. In my case, I crossed over it on a narrow snow bridge, and went straight down the face, all the way down to the riverbed hundreds of meters below. Definitely a fun way, but also full of intimidating glide cracks. An alternative would be to stick to the ridgeline left of that face, and make your way down to the riverbed at its end (although the face going down from that ridge didn’t look that great). Once you reach the riverbed, follow it slightly down for a while until you reach a crossing with a branch going down to the lefthand side, and another going up another river on the right. Skin up the right side until you reach an immense plateau. You’re almost there, all that’s left to do is skin accross it for a few kilometers until you reach the hut. If you are the first in the season, you might need to dig yourself some steps to reach the second floor’s entrance. The hut is fully equiped with a pile of futons and blankets, and enough toilet paper to outlast Covid. There are also a few half empty emergency gas canister and various other items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mountain hut  Day 2: From the hut to Hajiori OnsenNavigation the second day is much more confusing, as it makes it’s way up on down multiple of small hills, and the final destination is never in sight. You generally want to be heading north east. My track above should provide you with a reasonable outline of where to go, although I did not always end up taking the most direct path, and ended up backtracking a couple of times. Snow quality under 1400m was much less good, and a good chunk of that day is spent skiing under the treeline. Watch out for glide cracks and branches. The way up to the last summit barely had any snow cover, and I had to carry for a few hundred meters there. Fortunately, the long way down to Hijiori Onsen was fully covered in snow. Although the last few kilometers consist of an almost flat road full of wet sticky snow. Nothing better to make you long for that onsen. I suggest setting up camp in the woods a bit before reaching the village. You can leave your gear there, take your onsen kit and walk down the final hundred meter to the village for a well deserved rest. If you do not want to camp, you can also stay at one of the many Ryokans. Although in these covid times, Hijiori onsen looks like a ghost town, so if that’s your iintent, better make a reservation ahead of time.The local supermarket Kaneyama shop was very helpful in helping me figure out the bus schedule, and it is conveniently located next to a public onsen (single bath, no showers, no cleaning products, 300yen).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Second day  Day 3: Public transport - Return from Hijiori Onsen to Gassan ski resortGetting back to Gassan Ski Resort from Hijiori Onsen by public transports is definitely quite a journey.I ended up taking a bus from Hijiori Onsen to Shinjo station, then a train to Yamagata followed by a train to Aterzawa station. From there I walked 9km to reach Nishikawa IC, where one can take the bus to Gassan. While I was trying to figure out where the bus stop is (it’s here), a local, surprised to see me walking around in ski boots and with skis on my back decided to give me a ride to Gassan! I think a smarter way would be to take a highway bus from Yamagata to Nishikawa IC. There is a tunnel from the highway down to the local bus stop for Gassan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Return trip  ConclusionThis is defintely an interesting journey, bringing you deep into the mountains to places rarely explored. If you wish to flee the crowds of Gassan and find solitude deep into nature, that’s definitely a good option. The way up and down Gassan is very enjoyable, although crossing all these glide cracks alone was definitely intimitating. The second day through the lower altitude hills is definitely interesting, if not for the quality of the skiing, for its remoteness and sense of adventure. An onsen at the finish line does not hurt either!",

      "content"  : "Nikko: Ice climbing dreams, and hiking Mt. NantaiWhat better way to recover from my first (ever) 10K run of the previous day? Well, going for a walk obviously. This, however didn’t seem so obvious to my brain, that tried its best to prevent me from waking up by “mistakenly” pressing the stop button instead of snooze on the alarm (not that snoozing it is a much better idea in the first place). Despite its best efforts, this only delayed the inevitable by a mere hour, and after the recurring monologue I keep having with myself, aka “is it really worth going? it’s kinda late, kinda big drive for what it is, etc etc” - once again a desperate attempt of my brain to prevent me from doing anything - I was on my way to Nikko. I had originally intended to go check out the famous Kegon Falls, and then make my way to the Unryukeikoku Falls over the nearby summits. This proved to be more than I could chew, much further than I had initially envisionned, and my body state definitely not up for a 25km/2000m+ hike and the inevitable forray off the beaten path to find the falls, not to mention the limited remaining day-time. No matter, they can wait until they finally decide to freeze over, which considering how sharply the temperature drops in the evening, and the onset of snow and windblown frost on the nearby summits, shouldn’t take long!Kegon Falls - 華厳の滝 (Kegon no taki)Staring at the Kegon Falls now in late-autunm condition, I couldn’t help but wonder whether it had every beeen mixed-climbed. This high-flow waterfall certainly is impresssive, falling nearly 100m over the lid of a massive overhanding wall, and crashing down on the rocks below, where it is joined by many smaller streams leaking through the wall itself. This seems far too perfect a place not to have been attempted. From the pictures I could find, it does seem that for the most part it does form, although I suspect that the main pillar must rarely - if ever - be in condition. It sits at the rather low altitude of 1600m, and is not very deeply enclaved away from the sun. I’ll certainly keep it in mind, and try to find out more information!                                                                                                                        Kegon Falls  Unryukeikoku Falls - 雲竜渓谷Although I didn’t get the change to go have a look this time around, it seems that the Unryukeikoku Falls (雲竜渓谷 or Cloud Dragon Valley) offer a sure bet for a good ice climbing day. They are located deep in the mountains of Nikko, in a ravine between the rugged peaks of Mt. Nyoho and Mt. Akanagisan. More information can be found on the japan-guide blog post. See some images below for inspiration          Mt. Nantai HikeMt. Nantai is one of the landmark “100 Famous Japanese Mountains”, it rises from the north shore of Lake Chuzenji (Chuzenji-ko). On its summit lies the Okumiya (rear shrine) of Futarasan-jinja Shrine, one of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site “Shrines and Temples of Nikko”. But of course, not having done my research beforehand, I didn’t know that and simply set out to make my way up the slopes, while contemplating my ice climbing dreams. From Kegon falls, I headed up the nearest path I could find, which as it turns out ended up being a road for the first 5km. Not as boring as it sounds though, as it provided me with a nice easy walk through the sunny forest with occasional clear views on the magnificent lake beneath. Follows a much steeper trail straight up, passing though the 9 “stations”, most of which would make for a perfect bivy hut, one of them is being even equipped with a sleeping bag! Reaching the summit, I am greeted by the shrine and its statue, and a fellow japanese hiker, eager to teach me about the 日本刀 (nihontō), those large Janaese Swords that are commonly placed on or near the peak’s summits. This one is particularely massive, and with the most perfect sunny weather, one couldn’t ask for a better view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mount Nantai  I made my way down slowly to spare my ankle, still recovering from its bouldering-induced-injury), just in time to catch the sunset over lake Chuzenji. Now it’s more than time to get in shape for the winter season, looks like there is a lot to be done!",

      "content"  : "  Pachinko climbing, or the art of abseiling down a face and randomly selecting pitches to climb back out!Kaikomagatake from 31/12/2029 to 04/01/2020Freshly settled into Japan, it is more than time to go explore what mountaineering the country has to offer. And this adventure starts with a 5 days winter trip to Kaikomagatake (甲斐駒ヶ岳), a 2967m peak located in the Akaishi Moutains in Yamanashi Prefecture. It is one of the landmark “100 Famous Japanese Mountains”. It is best known in the winter season for its classic O-ren-dani right fork (黄蓮谷右俣) route, which, when in conditions forsm a near continous part gully, part canyon 3+ water-ice route for about 1200m! However, this route is not the objective of this trip. This time, our sight is set on the West face, a true paradise of serious mixed climbing here for the taking, for anyone motivated enough to get there! Without further due, a picture of the main (west) face, taken from the approach ridge.However, climbing there is nothing but easy, with its 1700m elevation gain approach, virtually no information about the face and the conditions. This is the perfect occasion to get introduced to the Japanese climbing style of “Pachinko”. For those not familiar with the term, Pachinko (パチンコ) is a japanese gambling game, roughly equivalent to what we would consider as casino. Except that gambling for money is not legally allowed in Japan, and these places exploit a legal loophole in the form of winning pachinko balls, which can later be exchanged with a third party for money. Applied to climbing however, this leads to a simple form of climbing where you simply get on a face, and select whichever pitch you feel like climbing ahead of you, until you (hopefully) get to the summit.Access  Nearest station: Kobuchizawa. You can get there either by train or bus from Tokyo.  Trailhead: Kaikomagatake Shrine. It is located about 12km from Kobuchizawa. The easiest way to get there from Kobuchizawa is by car or taxi. Otherwise, it may be  possible to reach the Oshira Hot Spring by bus.Summary / ConditionsWe went there for 5 days, from 31 December 2019 to 04 January 2020. This is the minimum length of time I would recommand to make a mixed climbing trip to the west face worthwile. Less than that and the ratio approach/climbing would be quite poor, and it would prevent from doing long multi-day climbings.  Day 1: Approach walk from the Kaikomagatake Shrine up to the 七丈小屋 lodge. ~1500m elevation gain. Icy path, and compact snow, no snowshoes required. Sleep in the lodge’s campground area.  Day 2: Walk about 200m higher up the ridge. A series of rappels (not equipped, on boulders, trees and abalakovs) brings us down the face. Tent bivy on a small tree crest on a snowslope about halfway up the face.  Day 3: Climb back up along the rightmost side of the west face. Sleep on a narrow snow ledge protected by an overhanging face.  Day 4: Climb back out, sleep at the campground area.  Day 5: Walk back downThe climbing conditions turned out to be quite difficult, with a lot of loose powder snow covering the granite slabs of the face, and close to no ice. This made protecting the climbing challenging, and progression slow.Day 1 - ApproachDefinitely not your typical approach, we’re looking at 1700m elevation gain through forest and a long ridge equipped with chains and ladders. All that with a full winter gear bag, cams, ice screws, gas, stove, food for 5 days, tent, ice axes… Nothing unmanageable either, and some 4 hours laters, we are getting ready to spent our first night by pitching the tent at the official camping area near the 七丈小屋 lodge. As the snow is deep, and we did not bring any shovel, we choose a spot along the ridgeline, which unsurprisingly proves to be poorly protected from the high winds of the night. But no matter, we are comfortably setting into the tent, with the gaz stove hanging from the tent’s ceiling.                                                                                                                          Your browser does not support the video tag.Day 2 - Let the game of Pachinko begin!The wind has died down, and after a nice breakfast and enjoying some sunlight, we start our way up the final part of the ridge. We stop about 200m higher, on a large flat area a bit after the large boulder with two broad swords on it, about halfway between the lodge and the summit. It is now time to start rapelling down the face. That is of course, without much of any idea of where we are heading for. A first rappel brings us down on a snowslope. From there, two easy pitch of snow traverse lead us to another series of rappels. Two 60m rappels from trees and one on abalokov lead us down a large couloir. From there starts an uncomfortable pitch of traversing and downclimbing in between grass and trees. One final 60+ meters rappel brings us down to a short snowslope halfway up the face. Damn, the sun sets early in the winter! We don’t have much daylight left, and it is already time to set camp. The ideal location is found after another pitch across the snowslope, on a small ridge surrounded by a few trees. After stomping out a flat spot there, we can finally pitch the tent, and repeat the cooking ritual.                                                                                                                                                          Day 3 - Sketchy Mixed approachAfter a good night of rest, breakfast, and taking the time to dry out the sleeping bags and tent into the morning sun, it is now time to start climbing our way out of the face. The day starts with a long sketchy traverse, up a snow slope perched on a granite slab. Despite my best efforts, the best piece of protection after 20m of climbing is a single cam lying dangerously close to the edge of a crack, freshly cleaned off its plants, dirt and loose rocks. A few meters later, a third of an ice screw comes to perfect this masterpiece of protection. Hopefully the climbing is not hard, although quite unusual: for feet a granite slab under loose snow, for axes, patches of frozen ground. A short traverse around a boulder brings to better protected terrain, up a steep snow-slope covered in trees. This brings us back to the top of the final rappel from the previous day. We are now faced with our first pachinko choice, which route will we attempt? A tempting line draws itself on a steep pillar accross the snow couloir. However, it seems that the second pitch is protected by a rather steep granite slab. Getting up it would most likely require artificial climbing, and we did not exactly bring specialized gear for that. Nevertheless, we let the temptation dominate, and I start up the first pitch, by an interesting dry-tooling traverse across a crack. It now becomes clear than getting up will not be an easy task, not because the climbing is hard, but because under the loose snow is a bunch of annoying bushes that prevent the ice-axe from even reaching the ground. The extra time it would take climbing through this uninteresting terrain, plus the time required to get up the artif pitch now seems quite unreasonable. We change our mind, and after downcliming the start of that pitch, are now headed towards the otherside of the couloir, which seems to offer an interesting mixed line up a narrow chimney. Building an anchor at its base does not prove easy, the rock is loose and there isn’t much of any cracks. After a while, I chance on an old piton, it seems that we are not the only one finding it hard to protect. Completed with two nuts, we can finally start up the pitch, without bag for the leader to simplify progression along the chimney. I follow up the pitch with my heavy bag on my shoulder, which forces me to stay on the ouside of the chimney, and dragging along the extra hauling rope trying my best to make it remain on the slab outside of the chimney, so that the haul bag does not get stuck on its way up. Operation successful, I am now reunited with my partner up the pitch. Once again, sunlight is stopping us, and it is already time to consider finding a suitable bivy spot. While my partner hauls the bag, I start stomping out an interesting open-air bivy, located on a slope along a slightly overhanging granite wall. Hopefully, there is a lot of snow, and I manage to stop out a flat area just large enough for two people, in-between the rock wall and an 800m drop down the face just behind a thin 50cm high snow-wall. This is exactly the kind of bivouac I was hoping for, halfway up the face, with nothing but our sleeping mats and bags to protect us from the outside world. It’s dinner time, the thermometer is now showing -12deg. We hang the stove from an ice-axed hooked onto the rock wall, cook our dinner and boil our reglementary two liters of water, and prepare for a good night sleep under the stars. What a bivy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Day 4 - Mixed climbingThe night was cold, but hopefuly the weather held, neither rain nor wind came to disturb our rest. Still, we wait for the sun to greets us from deep within our sleeping bags. With its first rays of light, comes the warmth of a new day. Coffee, breakfast, boiling more snow to fill our bottles, the morning ritual is now well in place, and this time, no need to fiddle with the tent, we can get to our climbing buisness. The first pitch looks interesting, and not extremely hard. I gladly start leading it. However, it’ll prove once again more challenging than it appears. After a first section up a chimney blocked by a large boulder, which I though would be the crux, I find myself on a steep snow slope with nothing but a cam and half an ice-screw for protection. Unfortunately, what I mistook for an easy hike up the face, proves to be a granite slab hidden beneat a meter of loose powder snow that does not offer enough resistance to the weight of my body, let alone any support for my ice tools, now releated to the mere role of snow-sweepers. Progression is laborious: cleaning the snow to find some small asperities on the face, stomping out precarious footsteps where possible. On the side, the rock is too chossy for any good protection. I’ll have to rely on two hooks no-so-firmly planted into a small ground-infested crack. Would that work? Doubtful, but it gives me enough confidence to continue two meters higher, where there looks like there should be a decent crack for protection. Once again, disappointment, it is barely deep enough for cams, and quite chossy at that. Starts the laborious task of hammering the choss away, and building a triangulated two-cams piece of proctection. Somewhat satisfied, a thing ice-crack a bit above allows for yet-another-half-screw. With that in place, I can finally find my way across the final section of the granite slab, with a single tool placement on a tiny patch on grass, and crampons on granite asperities. Quite precarious, but it works, and brings me to the much-welcome protection of a branch. The pitch is finally over, with one big lesson, don’t underestimate snow slopes! The rest of the day proves less eventful, between easily walkable snow couloirs, and a last pitch of interesting mixed climbing, with this time some decent rock. The day is over, and we have finally reached the ridge, not far from where we started our rappels two days ago. The rest of the evening is spent in luxury in the tent, buring away the remaining gas to heat up the tent and dry the gear out.                                                                                                                      Day 5 - Wrap upAn uneventful descent, with huge bags, 1500m of infinite descent along an icy path brings us back to the trailhead. The ratio of climbing to approach and scrambling might not have been very good on this trip, but this certainly was a very nice introduciton to managing big apline peaks in the winter. I am for sure coming out of this experience with much more confidence in facing long unknown routes across multiple days in the winter. Not to mention the many himalayan stories of my guide. Who knows, I might end up there sooner than I think!Armed with that new multi-day Pachinko climbing style, the only thing left to do is choose the next summit!",

Il s’agit là d’une première dans ce niveau de difficulté, tant pour moi que mon compagnion de cordée Julien. Armé de nos fidèles friends, câblés, broches à glace, et surtout de nos bien-aimés Nomics, nous voilà parti à l’assaut.

Un bon brassage dans le couloir d’approche se chargera de nous échauffer, et de nous humidifier. Les deux premières longueurs donnent le ton, raides, mélangeant fine glace, neige couic-couic et rocher. Un premier petit ressaut mixte et ses quelques mètres de M4 causera de sérieuses difficultés à Julien fort peu habitué à ce type de grimpe et à un tel engagement, les protections sur coinceurs se faisant maigres à cet endroit, et hors de question d’y mettre une broche! Une heure et demi plus tard, le voilà enfin au relai. Congelé, je m’empresse de le rejoindre, un peu trop vite visiblement, le sang revient dans mes doigts, une bouffée de chaleur m’envahit. S’en est trop, la douleur m’empeche de continuer. Me voilà à genoux, vaché à un friend. La douleur s’en va rapidement, me voilà réchauffé. Mon compagnon commence à douter, sa longueur difficile l’a visiblement fort entammé, et me voir torturé par les onglets n’a rien fait pour améliorer sa confiance. Qu’importe, la prochaine longueur est la plus dure, avec un dièdre de 50m de M4+. C’est magnifique, entre coincés de lame, ancrages dans de la neige/glace aléatoire, lolottes et placés de crampons, le tout protégé uniquement sur friends, câblés et broches très occasionnelle, tout y est dans cette longueur : c’est beau, c’est technique, c’est engagé! Julien me rejoins, visiblement bien plus à l’aise en second qu’en tete dans une telle longueur. La suivante est pour Julien, un petit ressaut mixte (M3), et la suite est plus banale, mais pas moins physique : 150m de pentes de neige raide. Et il n’y en a pas qu’un peu! On troque notre classe d’alpinistes pour une gestuelle bien moins subtile: la baleine !La sortie à l’antecime est magnifique, avec ses belles corniches. Quelques photos pour immortaliser le tous, et nous ne trainons pas: il nous reste encore la descente dans des pentes de neige raide et un peu exposées. 2h plus tard, nous revoilà à la voiture, avec une belle aventure dans la poche !",

C’est aux cinquièmes rassemblements de la première glace, organisés à la cascade artificielle d’Aiguilles-en-Queyras que l’expédition débute.  Une fine équipe, composée d’une partie des plagistes du groupe espoir (Amandine, Léonard et Arnaud), accompagnés de leur fidèle acolyte Nils, de quelques membres du CAF de Montpellier et de Nîmes, ainsi que de David-cul-mouillé et son amie Minni. Les cordes sont en place, la glace est bien là, et c’est officiel, la saison glace est lancée. De coups de piolets plus ou moins subtils en placements de pieds plus ou moins scabreux, aucune des lignes de la cascade ne nous résiste. Pas même les deux voies de dry-tooling. Certains bourrins, n’en ayant visiblement pas eu assez, se mettent en tête de mener un combat épique dans une voie mixte (M7) traversant le toit surplombant les cascades, fraîchement équipée par Christophe Moulin. Ils en ressortent plus ou moins victorieux, avec une belle chute en tête pour Arnaud, et une voie enchaînée par Nils! Nous voilà fin prêt pour continuer l’aventure sur des cascades naturelles. Mais d’abord, la traditionnelle pause familiale de Noël s’impose. Les plagistes s’accorderont chacun 4 jours de d’excès dans leur coin de France respectif, de Montpellier à Lyon en passant par la Bretagne, de quoi remplir les stocks de graisse nécessaires aux aventures à venir!                                                                                                                                                          Vercors - Traversée des Arrêtes du Mont GerbierIl est grand temps de digérer les repas de fêtes et de préparer le nouvel an! C’est dans le Vercors que les hostilités commencent, avec Amandine, Léonard, Arnaud et Louis à l’assaut de la traversée hivernale du Mont Gerbier. Pour Louis, ça sera une initiation bien complète aux courses d’alpinisme. Après 2h d’approche, les premières pentes du Mont Gerbier sont atteintes, et l’arrête tant désirée est enfin en vue.  Pour y mettre les pieds, 80m de goulotte s’offrent à nous, peu raide certes, mais avec quelques passage mixtes intéressant en ces temps peu enneigés. La dextérité légendaire d’Amandine-doigts-de-beurre frappe encore, et un gant se prend pour un pilote de bobsleigh, dévale la pente, ne s’arrêtant qu’une centaines de mètres en contrebas. Après avoir récupéré le coupable, s’en suivra 1,5km d’une magnifique arrête effilée au dessus des nuages, soufflée d’un vent fort agréable aux alentours des 70km. Quelques heures plus tard, nous en sortirons intact, et ce malgré les envies de luge d’Amandine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  CeillacLéonard nous abandonne pour aller s’enterrer sous terre dans les Pyrénées, ainsi que Louis pour un objectif encore moins alléchant: le travail. Pendant ce temps, les survivants Amandine et Arnaud s’en vont rejoindre Yvan à Champcella, à deux pas de Fressinières et des principaux secteurs de cascade de glace des Ecrins et du Queyras, un emplacement idéal! Les cascades de Ceillac sont en condition, un plan sûr pour débuter le reste du séjour. Après avoir gravi l’Arlésienne (WI4), fine mais solide, nous irons nous promener dans Easy Rider (WI3) bien plus fournie et fréquentée.                                                                                                                      Pré de Madame Carle - Cascade du Grand LausForts de cette première journée, et après des conseils généreusement partagés par un guide local, nous nous mettons en tête d’aller tenter notre chance à la fameuse Cascade du Grand Laus, au Pré de Madame Carle, au dessus d’Ailefroide. En été, l’accès se fait en voiture. En hiver, c’est une toute autre aventure: la route est fermée à Pelvoux. C’est donc à ski que nous entamons l’approche. Donnée en 2h30, il nous faudra finalement 4h pour atteindre le pied du colosse de glace. Une autre cordée de guide au dessus de nous, les conditions ne sont pas idéales, et il pleut des glaçons. Cela ne nous arrêtera pas, et Amandine se lance dans la première longueur, un bon WI3 en glace bien dure. Le relai sur broche en place, nous la rejoignons rapidement. La longueur suivante (WI4) se complique, et c’est Arnaud qui partira en tête. Le spindrift fait ses premières apparitions, compliquant d’autant plus la grimpe. Fort heureusement, dans cette longueur, les choix d’itinéraires sont multiples, et une traversée permet d’éviter le gros des chutes de glacées, et de faire un bon relais sur broches sur une vire protégée des éléments. Il est encore temps de continuer, et la longueur à venir semble intéressante. Il s’agit de la plus dure de la cascade, un bon WI4+. Je repart en tête, et la longueur tient ses promesses: de la bonne glace verticale, et une grimpe assez technique. Le début de la longueur est quelque peu protégé par un toit rocheux, faisant presque oublier le furieux spindrift quelques mètres à ma gauche. Malheureusement,  à cet endroit, la cascade forme un goulot naturel, et il n’est plus possible de l’éviter. Je m’engage dedans, et c’est parti pour une douche gelée, sous les éclats de neige et gravillons. Je suis dans un véritable brouillard glacial, une cascade de glace qu’ils disaient. Peut-être n’est-ce pas une si mauvaise description, les chutes d’eau laissent placent aux chutes de glace. Impossible de regarder en haut, les coulées sont trop denses. Impossible de voir ses propres crampons, il fait tout blanc ici! Il faudra plusieurs tentatives avant de trouver le courage de progresser d’une dizaine de mètres à l’aveugle pour atteindre une bonne lunule de glace. Mes compagnons me rejoignent, les principales difficultés enfin franchies. Enfin? Oui, car il est bientôt 16h30, bien trop tard pour continuer. Le froid nous pousse à l’efficacité, et un rappel sur abalakov est vite mis en place, il est grand temps de descendre. Un grand rappel de 60m plein gaz au beau milieu des coulées de neige incessantes, et c’est un bon thé chaud qui nous attend au pied de la cascade. On troque les piolets pour des batons, les grosses pour des ski, et c’est parti pour les 10km de descente à ski, de nuit, jusqu’à Pelvoux. La route est gelée, la descente se fera sans encombre en moins de 45mn. Une grosse journée de 12h plus tard, nous voilà de retour au chaud! Le sommet du Grand Laus nous échappe pour cette fois, mais il en restera une belle aventure!
