Finding information about climbing in Japan can be a daunting tasks. Where to go? How to find the guidebook? What about gear and anchors? How about local etiquette?

# Overview of climbing areas

I've always found it hard to get a good overview of what climbing Japan has to offer. If you ask about climbing in Japan, most people will happily point you in the direction of Ogawayama, which is undeniably one of the best sport climbing area in the country. But this can't be the only crag worth visiting now, can it? Of course not, but unfortunaltely discovering climbing areas relies mostly on the set of 4 guidebooks "フリークライミング 日本100岩場" (Free climbing japan, 100 rocks), that do nothing to inspire you to actually go climbing. These books, available in Japanese only, only contain vague descriptions of the climbing areas, and poorly drawn access maps and sketches of the main routes in each area. This information is often out-of-date, and missing a lot of recent developments. Still it remains the most comprehensive overview of most Japanese sport and trad climbing crags.

## Guidebooks

Here is a list (non-comprehensive) of the main guidebooks. Most of them can be found at the [Calafate shop](https://www.calafate.jp/) near Ogawayama/Mizugaki. If you're in the area, I invite you to visit them as they are very knowledgeable and friendly towards foreigners.

- フリークライミング 日本100岩場" (Free climbing japan, 100 rocks) - 4 volumes:
  - [フリークライミング日本100岩場1 北海道・東北 増補改訂版](フリークライミング日本100岩場1 北海道・東北 増補改訂版): Volume 1, covering all of Tohoku area and Hokkaido

- [Mizugaki Climbing Guidebook - English Edition](https://www.calafate.jp/esp/prdJA0211_MizugakiClimbingGuideE.html): This is the most well-made guidebook I've ever seen, it has it all.
