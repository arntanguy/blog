Finding information about climbing in Japan can be a daunting tasks. Where to go? How to find the guidebook? What about gear and anchors? How about local etiquette?

# Overview of climbing areas

I've always found it hard to get a good overview of what climbing Japan has to offer. If you ask about climbing in Japan, most people will happily point you in the direction of Ogawayama, which is undeniably one of the best sport climbing area in the country. But this can't be the only crag worth visiting now, can it? Of course not, but unfortunaltely discovering climbing areas relies mostly on the set of 4 guidebooks "フリークライミング 日本100岩場" (Free climbing japan, 100 rocks), that do nothing to inspire you to actually go climbing. These books, available in Japanese only, only contain vague descriptions of the climbing areas, and poorly drawn access maps and sketches of the main routes in each area. This information is often out-of-date, and missing a lot of recent developments. Still it remains the most comprehensive overview of most Japanese sport and trad climbing crags. This article compiles a list of some of the main climbing crags, along with pictures to hopefully inspire you to go and visit them!

## Guidebooks

Here is a list (non-comprehensive) of the main guidebooks. Most of them can be found at the [Calafate shop](https://www.calafate.jp/) near Ogawayama/Mizugaki. If you're in the area, I invite you to visit them as they are very knowledgeable and friendly towards foreigners.

The Japanese version has two volumes and covers more routes and crags, but the selection here is excellent and won't let you down.
- [Mizugaki Bouldering Area Guide (Japanese and English)](https://www.calafate.jp/esp/prdJA0213_MizugakiBoulderingAreaGuide.html): Excellent bouldering guidebook with high quality pictures and easy to understand access maps.
- [Ogawayama Bouldering Area Guide](https://www.calafate.jp/esp/prdJA0214_OgawayamaBoulderingAreaGuide.html)

## General guidelines

- Best season is typically spring and autumn. Summer is far too warm and humid (your best bet is Mizugaki/Ogawayama due to their high elevation), and in winter is usually too cold and snowy (ice climbing is great though).
- Toproping on fixed gear is usually not acceptable. Build your own anchor for toprope.
- Anchors are of various quality: from the omnipresent american death triangle on a bunch of slings from the last millenia to bomber chained anchors on glue-in bolts. In most areas there will be two carabiners that you can clip for lowering, but sometimes rings are used instead.
- Bolts vary in quality. You can find anything from old ringbolts, rusty 6mm bolts, to bomber 12mm expansion bolts or glue-ins. Sometimes all within the same area.
- Be respectful, leave no trace, replace fixed gear when damaged, respect the local rules (notably on parking)
- Bouldering: You can generally use other's crashpad if they're already placed on a boulder you want to climb (just ask). 

## Mizugaki (みずがき山)

Mizugaki is one of the largest climbing areas of Japan, with a rich climbing history. It has it all, bouldering, sport and trad, multipitch, and no matter how much you climb there you won't ever run out of things to climb. Mizugaki's multipich routes are a true heaven for granite and offwidth lovers!

- **Prefecture**: Yamanashi
- **Access**: [Mizugakiyamashizen Koen Camping Ground](https://goo.gl/maps/Szv7F76Uth9Fdhjj8)
- **Accomodation**: Campground or you can sleep in your car in the free parking lot in front
- **Access fee**: Free 
- **Style**: Trad multipich, sport multipitch, trad and sport single pitch, bouldering
- **Rock type**: Granite
- **Guidebook**: The Mizugaki guidebook is excellent, please refer to it for futher inspiration and all the information you will ever need for climbing in Mizugaki!
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. However due to its high elevation above 1600m, it is one of the best areas to survive climbing during the hot summer months. Winter is tricky, as temperatures are cold, and the access road to the main parking area is closed due to snow, which adds about a kilometer of walking.

## Ogawayama (小川山)

Ogawayama is a world-reknowned sport climbing and bouldering area, and is, along with its neighbour Mizugaki the biggest climbing area in Japan.

- **Prefecture**: Yamanashi/Nagano border
- **Access**: [Mawarimedaira Camping Ground](https://goo.gl/maps/hbQzR7BE35B4sYpr6)
- **Accomodation**: Campground ([website](http://w2.avis.ne.jp/~mawarime/))
- **Access fee**: 500yen/day for parking (you can use the campground facilities)
- **Style**: Single-pitch sport and trad, multipitch, bouldering
- **Rock type**: Granite
- **Guidebook**: Unfortunately there is no dedicated guidebook to Ogawayama's sport climbing yet, although one is rumored to be under development. Refer to the "free climbing japan vol 2" or [ogawayama.online](https://ogawayama.online/). For bouldering: [Ogawayama Bouldering Area Guide](https://www.calafate.jp/esp/prdJA0214_OgawayamaBoulderingAreaGuide.html)
- **Best period**: Same as Mizugaki. In the winter the campground is closed and the road is proabably inaccessible (at least from the lower campground gate). 

{% include carousel.html name="ogawayama" %}

## Futagoyama (二子山)

- **Prefecture**: Yamanashi
- **Access**: [Futagoyama Parking Lot](https://goo.gl/maps/xt7fguFFQ4pUN5GN7). Walk up the hiking trail until you reach a small col, the climbing areas are a few hundred meters down on the other side of that col. Going down on the left is the main overhanging wall for which Futagoyama is famous, on the right is other areas such as Candle Rock and the Central Arete.
- **Accomodation**: It is not recommended to stay in the Futagoyama parking lot at the trailhead. You can stay at a michi no eki down the road ([here](https://goo.gl/maps/uC2pnqcvxog2kGxL8)) or one of the nearby campgrounds. 
- **Access fee**: Free 
- **Style**: Mostly hard limestone sport climbing. Some multipitch. 
- **Rock type**: Limestone
- **Guidebook**: "free climbing japan vol 2", althought it is missing a lot of the recently developed routes.
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. Also suitable for rainy days. 

{% include carousel.html name="futagoyama" %}

## Yamadera

- **Prefecture**: Yamagata
- **Access**: Take the forest road on the left [here](https://goo.gl/maps/D9kRJh9zq6XGVryN7) and drive up the dirt road until you cross a small bridge and reach a large parking area ([about here](https://goo.gl/maps/ZaozFfF3MpQak3AE9)). Park, the trailhead is on the other side of the bridge on your left. Take the path going to the right until you reach a ridge with a clear view of the rock face on your left. Follow the trail up to it.
- **Crag GPS**: [38°17'39.4"N 140°28'23.1"E](https://goo.gl/maps/XwfEvb4Vd4vpHirDA)
- **Access fee**: Free
- **Style**: Sport
- **Guidebook**: "free climbing japan vol 1"
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. Inacessible in winter due to snow (the long logging road is not cleared) 

{% include carousel.html name="yamadera" %}

## Misaki (三崎公)

- **Prefecture**: Akita/Yamagata border
- **Access**: [Parking](https://goo.gl/maps/4F9aC8jU8HnhEt5c7). Walk along the coast path until you reach the small lighthouse. A few meters further down, there is a small climbers path leading down to the right towards the cliff edge through the vegetation (pay attention, it's barely noticeable). About a dozen meter down the path you'll find fixed ropes that will lead you all the way to the bottom of the cliffs.
- **Accomodation**: Campground or you can sleep in your car in the free parking lot in front
- **Access fee**: Free 
- **Style**: Seaside climbing with mostly sport single pitch, some trad.
- **Difficulty**: Mostly 5.11 and above. A few easier routes.
- **Rock type**: Basalt (Volcanic)
- **Guidebook**: "free climbing japan vol 1"
- **Best period**: Spring and Autumn. During the rainy season and summer months it is far too humid for climbing (great for swimming though). In winter rough sea typically prevents access.

## Maruyama (Toaru)

Maruyama is a climbing area near Mount Tsukuba, small but seeing active development. Information is hard to come by, most people (even Japanese) don't know of its existence. I'll do my best to write a separate detailed post about it as soon as possible.

- **Prefecture**: Ibaraki
- **Access**: The main crag is located here: [36°17'24.6"N 140°09'18.3"E](https://goo.gl/maps/Vk8nGy2MKPBnktRA7), just after wind turbines and a small shrine. There are boulders along the road leading up to it. If you go there on weekends it is likely that you'll find people there.
- **Guidebook**: None. There is a [private facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/453494212763649) that you can join to get information from the locals. If you're interested in climbing there contact me, and I'll introduce you (this was my local crag for over a year).
- **Style**: Short sport routes and bouldering
- **Rock type**: Granite
- **Best period**: Spring, Autumn, Winter. Too warm and humid in the summer, and mosquitoes are annoying.
