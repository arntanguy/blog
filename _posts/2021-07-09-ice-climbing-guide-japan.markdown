Finding information about ice climbing in Japan can be a daunting task to say the least. Where to go? When? How to get there? What about guidebooks? How about weather? The list goes on...

# Overview of ice climbing in Japan 

Japan is a great country for ice climbing, due to its cold winter. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these winter typically come loaded with insane amounts of snowfall, often making access difficult. The best period is typically from december to february, although some rare falls might be formed earlier and last slightly longer. Ice falls can be found here and there throughout north Japan, with some well-known areas such as Yatsugatake, Yonagofudo, Sounkyo (Hokkaido) to name but a few. Access by public transport is usually hard, or downright impossible (except to at least add a significant taxi fare). Car is pretty much the only reasonable way of getting to most places. Beware that Japan tends to get insane amount of snowfall during winter, and you will need winter tires and 4 wheel drive. I've personally managed to get everywhere, including Hokkaido in January, with a 4WD Suzuki Wagon Kei-car. More often than not, expect a significant approach hike through snow. Some approaches are best done on skis. Due to this difficult access, it is very common to go for multiple days and winter bivy.

{% include carousel.html name="overview_carousel" %}

Without further due, let's introduce some of the main ice climbing venues.

# Honshu

Thinking about ice climbing in Japan, the first place that comes to mind is Hokkaido. But don't let that fool you, the main island Honshu is just as teeming with ice-falls, although the ice season is shorter, roughly december to end of february.

## Yatsugatake

**Access**: The trailhead starts at the lodge [八ケ岳山荘](https://goo.gl/maps/3EYWGXvGQ6v4e7DHA). This trailhead is accessible by a combination of train and taxi (around 6000yen from the station). You can sleep there for cheap if needed. If you have a car with winter tires and chains, depending on road conditions, you might be able to make it as far as the lodge [赤岳山荘](https://goo.gl/maps/v9d5j7DUT46KotL29), which saves about 3km of walking. This dirt road tends to be very icy, take care. From there, walk for about 2 hours along the trail leading to the Akadake Kosen Hut [赤岳鉱泉](https://goo.gl/maps/hxCWqcc8tqTakAgy9). It is very common to camp around the hut for a small fee. From the hut, one can access the many climbing options around.

**Classic climbs**:
- Akadake Kosen Ice Candy: Artificial ice fall next to the hut. Rental gear is available at the hut. Toprope only (I believe that you need to bring your own rope).
- 大同心 waterfall ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/YJfwK4FbVcpXdS766)): ~50m waterfall, WI4. From the hut, walk up the trail through the forest. The trail eventually turns to the left and the path ahead is blocked by a rope. There pass under the rope and continue up the riverbed until you reach the base of the waterfall. For a more complete adventure you can continue climbing the couloir above and link it with the classic mixed climb of [Shodoushin Crack (小同心クラック) (full route description)](https://climbjapan.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-kodoushin-crack.html), or of the [Daidoushin Ryo (full route description)](https://climbjapan.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-daidoushin-ryo-on-mt-yatsugatake.html).
- West face Shu-ryo of Akadake (赤岳主稜) ([route description](https://climbjapan.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-west-face-shu-ryo-of-akadake.html)). Easy mixed climbing leading to the ridge just short of the summit of Akadake.
- There is another popular waterfall at [35°58'37.5"N 138°20'52.3"E](https://goo.gl/maps/gYF8m3tNQhHbVSJC9). From Akadake Kosen, walk to the next hut [行者小屋](https://goo.gl/maps/sTJwE1WC4YaC4pJn6). Just after the hut, take the path leading down on your right until you reach the river. From there follow the river until you reach the waterfall, about a hundred meters up on your left accross the river. 

{% include carousel.html name="yatsugatake_carousel" %}

## Yonagofudo

Yonagofudo is known for its hard multipitch ice falls, some of which boasting over 120m of WI5 climbing.

- **Access**: The road leading to Yonagofudo is only partially cleared in the winter. You should be able do drive until a crossing a few hundreds meters after the [水神様](https://goo.gl/maps/xisGPJK5NDaj9WKg8) shrine, about [here](https://goo.gl/maps/XUg91iozD51YJx4cA). If you're lucky you might be able to keep making it up the road until reaching a closed barrier a few kilometers higher. Watch out as you might very well be able to drive up on the hard packed snow in the early morning but might not be able to make it back down in the afternoon after the snow has softened. Last time I went there my kei car bottomed out and got stuck and we had to dig it out). I've heard similar stories from multiple locals. Upon reaching the barrier up the road, keep walking (snowshoes or skis) for about 2 to 3 hours until you eventually see the falls in front of you. There is a bridge on your left, ignore it and keep going straight towards the falls. About 100m after the bridge is the area where people typically camp. Store the gear you don't need there, and keep going towards your project :)
- **Best period**: Late January to early February
- **Classic climbs**:
  - Dragon God (WI4, ~60m)
  - Anaconda (WI4, ~60m)
  - Cobra: 120m, WI5 with a snow slope between the firsts and last pitches
  - Cobra left: WI5+, left of Cobra, this route is rarely in condition

{% include carousel.html name="yonagofudo_carousel" %}


## Oyafudo

**Disclaimer**: Due to a conflict between local climbers and the landowners (temple?) a few years ago, access to this area is currently discouraged (as of 2021). From what I've gathered from the locals, the conflict arised over fecal matter due to the high popularity of the area, relatively easily accessible from Tokyo. Sadly I'm not sure if any steps are being taken to try and resolve the issue, it seems to be more of a wait-and-see situation. If you decide to ignore this disclaimer, please be particularely respectful and leave no trace.

{% include carousel.html name="oyafudo_carousel" %}

## Arafuneyama

Gunma prefecture is not particularely known for ice climbing. Yet Arafuneyama has some high quality ice-falls, along with some gullies and mixed routes.

{% include carousel.html name="arafuneyama_carousel" %}


## Kaikomagatake

See the [Kaikomagatake - Pachinko Climbing post]({{site.baseurl}}/kaikomagatake).


# Hokkaido

Hokkaido is most well-known for the insane amount of snow it receives during the winter months (sometimes meters in a single day), making it a world-renowned skiing destination. It also happens to be a heaven for ice climbing, with its low temperatures, and multitude of ice falls. The most well-known area is the Sounkyo gorge teeming with multipitch waterfalls a short walk above the river.

## Sounkyo

## Mount Raiden

## West coast

Unfortunately, when we travelled around Hokkaido in January 2021, most of the seaside ice falls along the west coast of Hokkaido weren't formed, with the exception of Mount Raiden described above. Here is an overview of the partially formed ones.
