Finding 17 contiguous vacation days with a standard job in Japan is no easy feat. For me, this involved combining all of my meager 10 days of official yearly paid-off, with two bank hollidays, and the few days of new years lab closure time. Armed with the longest stretched of free time since I moved to Japan over a year ago, it was time to get on the road and explore around Japan. What better way to do that than through an ice-climbing and skiing road-trip though the northern part of Honshu and Hokkaido? I can't think of one. Or maybe I can, why not make it more challenging and add winter camping to the mix!

# Part 1: Honshu

No time to waste, straight after work on the Friday evening, with the car already fully packed with all the gear one might need -- from backcountry ski equipement to ice climbing gear, winter camping, food, etc -- I set off to sqeeze in an extra day of ice climbing with my friend Trent. The plan is to go explore Oyafudo, near Nagano. Definitely not on the way to Hokkaido, but who cares, I have one free day before the official start of the trip, and no intention to waste it! Plus, he happens to be currently managing a very nice lodge, currently deserted of its owners and guests (see Covid-19 isn't all that bad), thereby making it the most perfect resting place after 4 hours of driving, and making my kei-car figh its way up through 20-30cm of fresh snow on the way up there. "The roads are clear", Trent said! I guess that's what passes as cleared roads in the middle of the night in Nagano ;)

## Oyafudo Ice Climbing

> **DISCLAIMER**: Climbing in Oyafudo has been strongly discouraged for the last couple of year. If you are a strong ice climber and have the time for it, consider checking out Yonagofudo instead.
As far as I can tell from discussion with the locals, a few years ago there was a conflict between climbers and the land owners (of the temple?), with the claim that fecal matter had become an issue. Due to its ease of access, and relatively accessible ice climbing grades, this place had become a popular basecamp for ice climbing trips (which typically comes with its fair share of winter camping). As a result climbers have been laying off coming here "until the situation is resolved". However, as far as I can tell, nothing is actually being done about it, and people simply magically hope that it'll somehow work itself out. Personally, I strongly disagree with closing off outdoor area, unless there is a very serious and unavoidable reason to it (preservation of species, significant archeological site, etc). Some will frown upon us having been up there despite knowing this, however do keep in mind:
- that we did this as a day trip (thus avoiding the fecal matter issues)
- that there is absolutely no sign in place mentioning anything about ice climbing being forbidden there (yes we actually went ahead google translating the signs along the access road)
- the icefalls themselves are far off into the forest, nowhere near close any temple
- we were respectful of the place, leaft no trace behind, and replaced old dangerous fixed gear at the anchor (two rotten pitons in the same crack, poorly linked with even more rotten slings)

- Approach: 2h
- Climbing: From WI4 to WI6
- Climb of the day: WI4

With that disclaimer out of the way, let's get back to the buisness of climbing. Afer an early rise and copious breakfast in the hut, a short stop to the barely opening gas station and a konbini coffee, we are finally ready to drive up the small narrow road leading to the trailhead. The amount of snow will however soon stop us from going any further, despite driving a proper 4x4. It's now time for the approach, about 2h of snowshoeing, partly on the road, partly on a forest trail. These Japanese approaches to ice climbing are definitely unusual to one being used to the French alps: you feel like you're walking up to nowhere, and that there definitely can't be any climbing around, just endless paths in the forest. As always, this feeling proves to be wrong, and an icefall suddently appears in front of us. Unfortenately, it is not in very good condition, with pretty wet ice and hard to protect, and the top pillar barely attached. Not the best conditions for the first climb of the year, but we make it work anyways, climbing it halfway to the first anchor. Or rather whatever passes for an anchor in these parts: two rotten pitons in the same crack, barely 10cm apart, apparently randomly linked with a piece of now rotten sling. Of course not triangulated, nor tighlty linked together, no that'd be far too safe. Just a slig threaded through both pitons... Time to set up a more reasonable anchor, I add a third piton in an independent crack, cut down the rotten sling, and replace it with a properly triangulated length of cordelette. Now that feels proper and we'll spend the rest of the day toproping various lines from it. Straight down the anchor is a steep, albeit short pitch of decent WI4 climbing. To the left is a bit of mixed climbing. Not the best ice every, but still an enjoyable day.

Note that when conditions are there, Oyafudo boast some much serious falls slightly higher up, grading up to WI6. However, it would have definitely been much too warm for those to be formed yet, and we didn't go check them out.
