# Kaikomagatake from 31/12/2029 to 04/01/2020

Freshly settled into Japan, it is more than time to go explore what mountaineering the country has to offer. And this adventure starts with a 5 days winter trip to **Kaikomagatake** (Áî≤ÊñêÈßí„É∂Â≤≥), a 2967m peak located in the Akaishi Moutains in *Yamanashi Prefecture*. It is one of the landmark ["100 Famous Japanese Mountains"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Famous_Japanese_Mountains). It is best known in the winter season for its classic [*O-ren-dani right fork (ÈªÑËìÆË∞∑Âè≥‰ø£)*](https://climbjapan.blogspot.com/2016/01/kaikomagatake-o-ren-dani-right-fork.html) route, which, when in conditions forsm a near continous part gully, part canyon *3+* water-ice route for about 1200m! However, this route is not the objective of this trip. This time, our sight is set on the West face, a true paradise of serious mixed climbing here for the taking, for anyone motivated enough to get there! Without further due, a picture of the main (west) face, taken from the approach ridge.

# Access

- Nearest station: **Kobuchizawa**. You can get there either by train or bus from Tokyo.
- Trailhead: [**Kaikomagatake Shrine**](https://goo.gl/maps/rukyjZkabUnb2LuA9). It is located about 12km from Kobuchizawa. The easiest way to get there from Kobuchizawa is by car or taxi. Otherwise, it may be  possible to reach the Oshira Hot Spring by bus.


# Summary / Conditions

This was a 5 days trip, from 31 December 2019 to 04 January 2020:

- Day 1: Approach walk from the Kaikomagatake Shrine up to the [‰∏É‰∏àÂ∞èÂ±ã lodge](https://goo.gl/maps/8sMCozNjfa1Jzpnu5). ~1500m elevation gain. Sleep in the lodge's campground area.
- Day 2: Walk about 200m higher up the ridge. A series of rappels (not equipped) brings us down the face. Tent bivy on a small tree crest on a snowslope about halfway up the face. 
- Day 3: Climb back up along the rightmost side of the west face. Sleep on a narrow snow ledge protected by an overhanging face.
- Day 4: Climb back out, sleep at the campground area.
- Day 5: Walk back down

The climbing conditions were quite difficult, with a lot of loose powder snow covering the granite slabs of the face, with close to no ice.

# Report

Kaikomagatake Expedition 31/12/2029 - 04/01/2020

Have you ever wondered how winter climbing is done in Japan? The answer lies in the famous game of Pachinko. Applied to climbing, this translated to three simple steps: 
- choose a mountain
- get on the face
- choose whichever pitch you feel like doing with no topo until you reach the summit.


## Day 1 - Approach

Not your typical approach, we're looking at 1700m elevation gain through forest and a long ridge equipped with chains and ladders. All that with a full winter gear bag, cams, ice screws, gas, stove, food for 5 days, tent, ice axes...
The first night is spent on the official camping area on the ridge with some proper wind!

## Day 2 - Pachinko Rappelling

You're now on top of the ridge, not that far from the summit. How do you start climbing? The answer is simple, randomly rappel, traverse, walk down couloirs for a full day until you find a suitable bivy spot. This time, we'll be setting up tent ‚õ∫ on a small tree üå≤crest in the center of a snow slope, at about the middle of the face. Only one way out now, up!

{% include carousel.html name="day2Carousel" %}


## Day 3 - Sketchy Mixed approach
That's it, time to go up the face. The day starts with a long sketchy traverse, up a snow slope perched on a granite slab. Despite my best efforts, the best piece of protection after 20m of climbing is a cam lying dangerously close to the edge of a plant-infested crack, and a third of an ice screw. Follows traversing around a boulder with I've screws planted in grass, crampons on loose snow and granite slab. The theme is given. Next we go up a steep deep snow slope with occasional protection on trees. Follows a snow traverse to a large couloir. The game of Pachinko starts: will it be the pillar on the left with potentially a pitch of slab aid climbing, or the mixed crack on the right? After about 5m of interesting dry tooling on the left choice, we reconsider, there is only 3 hours of daylight left, and it doesn't look like we could pass the slab aid pitch (with no aid gear) before nightfall. The mixed chimney on the right it is. Ed starts ahead without his bag to make his way through the narrow chimney. Once again, interesting gear placement, with half an ice screw, and two hooks in grass to protect the crux. While Ed deals with hauling his bag, I'm left with the task to find a suitable bivy. After a good 30mn of effort making a flat platform out of snow, we're now set up on a small ledge barely wide enough for two, protected on one side by the rock face, on the other by a thin 50cm wall of snow dropping off towards the bottom of the face 800m below. The stove hanging from an ice tool, a thermometer showing -12¬∞, we're getting ready for our first open-air bivy. Hopefully the weather holds, and this end up being a nice quiet star filled night, best observed from deep within the sleeping bag.

## Day 4 - Mixed climbing
The sun greets us, the first pitch a mere 20m around the corner of our bivy. From the bottom it looks rather easy: a short mixed chimney blocked by a boulder with an exit on thin ice, followed by a steep snow slope. The first part goes according to plan, a good cam under the boulder, a fair bit of shuffling around with an oversized backpack, half a screw later, the crux is passed. Or is it? The snow slope proves to be far too loose to walk on. Digging through that meter of powder reveal a granite slab, with little to no chance of protection. The first one is two hooks filling a ground-filled crack. A few metres higher, after a fair bit of hammering loose scree rock out of a barely cam-deep crack, two cam are triangulated. Will they hold? Doubtful. Gathering the courage to make a few more steps on the snow covered mystery granite face, and the protection is now complete with a good half screw in a barely 10cm wide piece of ice... Luxury. The rest of the pitch looks even more blank, no crack or ice on the edge to save me this time. The only viable option, traversing the slab 5m to the left to reach some grass and trees a bit higher. But first, we need to see what we're dealing with, and it's only after a good 10mn of clearing the snow off the face that the solution appears... In the form a a few centimetres wide patch of grass, and some small granite asperities for the feet. Trusting that one I've axe placement takes a lot, but the feet go exactly as planned, and before I know it, the traverse is over, with a good doing on a branch.

Follows an easy snow slope to gain some height, and one less eventful mixed pitch before reaching the ridge. The evening is spent in luxury in the tent back at the ridge campground. A lot of gas to spare, the stove is left on to dry and great our home.

## Day 5 - Descent
Huge bags, 1500m of infinite descent on a steep icy path brings us back to the trailhead.

The ratio of climbing to approach and scrambling might not be very good, but this certainly was a very nice experience of winter climbing big alpine peaks, with evenings filled with the many experiences of my guide in the Himalaya. Armed with that new multi-day Pachinko climbing style, the only thing left to do is choose the next summit!
